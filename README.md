# A.I. Tools
## A few tools I use during A.I. dev work of various kinds
Below is a list of all the various items in this repo as well a what they do. None of them are major A.I. programs and many are more for experimenting than they are practicality, but I decided to share them all here should someone find use in them.  

## ImageDataPrep.py
Bulk resize and crop images from the center, as well as giving them UUIDs. Can also split an image set into "training" and "testing" data based on a given percentage

## CV Backgrounds
Various printable backgrounds I used to experiment and add diversity to computer vision datasets
